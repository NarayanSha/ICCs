# ICCs
Compute intraclass corelation 1 and 2 in R

ICC1 and ICC2 for binary data using rptR

Repeatability relates to the way of quantifying the reliability of measurements
Oﬀers insights into the components contributing to variability in the data
Describes the variance into within-group and between-group sources of variance 
and is more generally referred to as the intra-class correlation (ICC1)

ICC2: A useful index of the quality of the test with the number of items and the average correlation is the Signal/Noise ratio λj
